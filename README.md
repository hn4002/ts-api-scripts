# TradeStation API Scripts
Some scripts to test the functionl APIs in the TS APIs

The sensitive info has been "externalized" into a different file. The file is `lib/tslib/setenv.py`. Update it with the right values for your app. Depending on where you put `setenv.py` on your system, update `local_lib_dir` global variable in the other scripts to load it.

The scripts to test the functional APIs are in `scripts/tsScripts` directory.
